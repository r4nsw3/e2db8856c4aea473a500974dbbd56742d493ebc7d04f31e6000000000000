  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and         |
  |   claim more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action.                          |
  |   Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a     |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear.           |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v4.5.0 (v2097152)                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As was announced earlier today, a new update has gone live for        |
  |   Splatoon 2. The game is now at version 4.5.0.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing players who performed a dodge roll in        |
  |     specific locations on Kelp Dome during Tower Control or Clam        |
  |     Blitz matches to be treated as if they had fallen out of bounds     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue occurring on Piranha Pit during Tower Control        |
  |     matches, allowing players riding the moving tower to take a         |
  |     shortcut into the opposing team's base via an elevated platform.    |
  |     As a result of the above fix, the route taken by the tower in       |
  |     Tower Control matches has been altered slightly. Fixed an issue     |
  |     occurring on certain stages when certain symmetrically placed       |
  |     objects were inked, causing minor discrepancies between the         |
  |     actual area inked and the area inked shown on the results screen    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue allowing attacks with rollers to pass through the    |
  |     opened brellas of opponents, defeating the brella user              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing a Splashdown special used by an opponent     |
  |     to shift locations when network conditions are poor                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue when using the Ultra Stamp causing the top of        |
  |     crates not to be inked when swinging the stamp while on the         |
  |     ground and near a wall                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing the ink tank strap to not properly reflect   |
  |     your team's color when using a Splattershot Jr., Custom             |
  |     Splattershot Jr., or Kensa Splattershot Jr                          |
